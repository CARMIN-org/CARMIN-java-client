# CARMIN-java-client
A CARMIN-API java client 

## Introduction

This java library allow to easily communicate with a CARMIN server through the CARMIN API. 
The current version targets the 0.3 version of the CARMIN API. 
It should be working, but there may be some bugs remaining.
There will soon be a release after some more testing.

## How to use

Clone, install with maven (`mvn install`), and then add it as a dependency :

```
<dependency>    
    <groupId>org.carmin</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
Use the `ApiClient` class to configure the CARMIN server (`setBasePath()` for the url and `setApiKey()` for the api key).
Then the `DefaultAPi` class contains all the CARMIN features. 

## Note

The client was initialy generated by the swagger codegen tool, from the CARMIN API 0.2. 
With the new CARMIN API 0.3 version, the specification format changed from swagger (version 2) 
to the OpenAPI Specification (Version 3), and the swagger codegen tool could not be used anymore.
The initial client was then edited manualy to be comform to the CARMIN API 3.0 changes.
